    <h1>Audio Visualizer Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Audio Effect Nodes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Highshelf: </b> This filter is an instance of BiQuadFilter. It changes the loudness of higher frequencies
            of sound.</li>
        <li><b>Lowshelf: </b> Similar to highschelf, this filter changes the loudness of lower frequencies of sound.
        </li>
        <li><b>Distortion: </b> This filter transforms frequencies using a certain formula.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sprite Class</h2>
    <p>My sprite class takes in the audio data and uses it to change the width and height.
        The width represents the lower frequencies, while the height represents the higher frequencies. The draw
        function uses all of the fields for position, scale, and size, while the update function takes in the new
        audio data every frame and calculates the scaling. The exact formula used includes taking the average of a range
        of frequencies. The 8 lowest are counted as bass while the rest are counted as treble.</p>
    <h2>App Data</h2>
    <p>Here is what I included in my JSON file: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Title</b></li>
        <li><b>Songs:</b> names and filenames</li>
        <li><b>Sprites:</b> filename, position, and size</li>
        <li><b>Starting</b> settings</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Asthetics</h2>
    <p>These are the main things I changed in my app: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Radial Display: </b>I changes the previous circles into a radial display. The angle of each segment is
            reflected by the frequency, while the radius and color are reflective of the loudness.</li>
        <li><b>Spectrogram: </b>I replaced the bars with a spectrogram. I created a new class to store a frame of audio.
            The class draws the frame in segments from the top to the bottom of the screen; low frequency to high
            frequency. The color and width of each segment reflects the amplitude of loudness of that frequency</li>
        <li><b>Gradient:</b> I changed the gradient to be at an angle and have more meloow tones to not be so garish</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Blur: </b>I implemented Gaussian blur as an option to effect the canvas. Unfortunately since it uses the
            CPU and is on a browser it becomes very laggy. However, I did complete quite a bit of research and
            development to understand the formula and procceses.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Self Grade</h2>
    <p>I would grade myself 13% / 15%. I did a good amount of work and added new ideas to the project. It doesn't have
        many features that blend well together but technically they are interesting.</p>

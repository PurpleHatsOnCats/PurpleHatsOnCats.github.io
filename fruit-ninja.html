                <p class="indent">In my third semester at RIT I took the class Interactive Media Development, where we learned the basics of creating games in 2D and 
                    3D. We used the Unity game engine to create several projects, one of them being this Fruit Ninja project. The assignment was to 
                    re-create the basic mechanics of fruit ninja. I went beyond these requirements by attempting to have the fruits visually split in 
                    half when they were cut. I accomplished this by creating an equation for a circle-line intersection and utilizing Unity’s mask 
                    component.

            <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
            <p class="indent">This project is a re-creation of the mobile game Fruit Ninja, but what does that include exactly? The assignment requirements 
                needed a full gameplay loop, with a losing condition and some kind of objective; it didn’t have to be the exact same as the 
                original game. However, the main gameplay must consist of the user dragging their finger (or mouse) across the screen to slice 
                fruit. This meant there were three main mechanics to implement:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Object creation - fruit needed to be spawned, shot up into the screen, and then deleted when they should.</li>
                <li>Slicing detection - the user’s input needed to be collected, and used to determine if each fruit was cut or not.</li>
                <li>Cut fruit - cut fruit had to result in something: for my project, a cut fruit counted for a point and then needed to 
                    visually split in half.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Math</h3>
	        <p>
                We were given two option for collision detection:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Using Unity’s built in 2D collision detection</li>
                <li>Manually calculating each frame if a fruit had collided with the slicing action.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I chose the latter, because I love this kind of math and wanted to practice my algebra skills. The pure math way also had some 
                benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It provided an easier way to correctly interpolate a fruit that was moving fast (which I actually didn’t do for this 
                    project)</li>
                <li>It gave more information about the collision that I would use later on.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <p class="indent">At first, the geometrical problem was how to determine if a line and circle were colliding or not. I attempted approaching the 
                problem by myself at first, then consulted some online resources for a hint after a while. Once I grasped the concept I worked out 
                the algebra myself, and replicated it in the online calculator Desmos. Once I did this, I realized there was another problem for 
                determining if a fruit is cut.
            </p>

                    bottom right.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="indent half-screen">I played around with the original game to research the mechanics, specifically how the game determined 
                if a fruit was cut or not. I used a fruit the game has on its menu that didn’t move, slowly cutting it in different ways. 
                I determined that a fruit is considered cut if the distance from the entry point to the cursor is equal to or greater than a 
                certain threshold. To calculate this, I needed to know the exact point the player’s swipe entered the fruit as well as the current 
                position of the cursor.
            </p>
            <p class="indent half-screen">In a circle-line collision, there can be up to two intersection points. To determine which point is the 
                first,I added a parameterization to my equations to represent the time from the origin point to the end of the line segment in 
                this collision. I created an equation and inserted it into the Desmos software, comparing the “time” that each intersection point 
                occurred. Seeing that it worked as it should, I start implementing the equations into my Unity project with C#. However, I ran 
                into an error when testing that would always cause my program to crash. I tracked down the issue into my math, and realized that 
                I had failed to account for completely vertical slices. When a line is completely vertical, its slope is unidentified since it 
                would be dividing by 0. To handle this scenario I added a conditional statement that used a vertical line equation to get the 
                point I needed.

            <h3>Masking</h3>
            <p class="indent">This assignment only required us to have the fruit in our project be deleted after they were cut. However, once I 
                found out the details of the project I was immediately determined to recreate the visual slice; fruit being split into two 
                segments. I asked my TA how one might approach that challenge, and she explained the general idea of using the original fruit 
                object and creating a new second object. Each object would show half of their sprite, effectively resulting in two split segments. 
                That is the path that I ended up following. I understood the concept somewhat; the real challenge laid in exactly how to correctly 
                rotate (and actually use) the masks in unity. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">At first I had settled for having the masks not rotate; they would result in the same two shapes always being made 
                after a fruit would be cut. However, after working on collision math and programming I realized I already had the information 
                needed to find the angle the player had cut the fruit. My code was already defining a line that represented the player’s cutting 
                gesture; I just needed to convert that into an angle and rotate the masks accordingly. I quickly became excited at this idea; 
                both because it would make the cut fruit behave more realistically, but also because it would add another layer of challenge 
                (not too challenging) to the project.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">While attempting to implement the masks, I ran into several issues. First, I had no idea how to apply a mask to only one 
                object; by default a mask would hide any object in its area. Second, I had to rotate as well as offset the mask, since they were 
                in a rectangle shape, and I only wanted half of each object to be hidden. The third and most important issue was that the angles 
                were not correctly corresponding to the player’s gesture.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="media/FruitNinja/testing-slices.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>An example of testing the results of slicing; the empty space in the middle of the fruit shows that the masks are 
                    overlapping - which should not have been happening.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="indent half-screen">The first two issues were easy enough to solve; reading documentation and forums helped quite a bit. The third issue was 
                difficult because I didn’t know where my code had gone wrong. Was it my algebra? Did I input the equations incorrectly?  Was I 
                using the wrong trigonometric functions to get an angle? I resorted to creating several instances of fruit that I could test 
                cutting and then inspecting the resulting angle the masks took. I found there was no discernible direct relation between the 
                players input and the result (although there was some kind of pattern). I gathered from this observation that I had messed up 
                one of my equations, so I went back to my math code and ran through it line by line, comparing it with my algebra from Desmos 
                (since it had shown the visual results I knew it was correct). I found an error I made when copying code; it was similar to what 
                I had copied but I forgot to change a variable or two. Changing this fixed the rotation and the cut fruit correctly correlated to 
                the player’s gestures.
            </p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>This project was a lot of fun to work on - it was also very frustrating. I had never worked with masks before and the mathematical 
                errors were difficult to find. Despite those hardships I did enjoy pinpointing the exact spot that I had made an error, and the 
                resulting resolution of the output. Looking back, there were several small features I wish I had attempted to add, such as 
                offsetting the masks to reflect precisely where the player had swiped (and not just through the center). Most importantly, I have 
                learned the lesson of checking my code’s output as I gradually build it up, so that I don’t have to take the pain of checking an 
                untested mountain of code. In the end I am still proud of what I got accomplished, especially because of the struggle I went 
                through.
